        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests sent by code executed in the browser.
        </p>

        <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.</p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.
        </p>
        <code>const Früh = "foobar";
        </code>
        <p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).
        </p>
        <p>
            A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.</p>
        <P>It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
        <p>
            The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Whitespace">whitespace</a>. (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
        <header>Comments</header>
        <p>
          The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:
        </p>
        <code>
          // a one line comment <br>
         /* this is a longer,<br>
        &nbsp* multi-line comment<br>
        &nbsp*/
        </code>
        <p>>
          You can't nest block comments. This often happens when you accidentally include a */ sequence in your comment, which will terminate the comment.
        </p>
        <code id="error">
          /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */
        </code>
        <p>
          In this case, you need to break up the <code>*/</code> pattern. For example, by inserting a backslash:
        </p>
        <code>
          /* You can /* nest comments *\/ by escaping slashes */
        </code>
        <p>
          Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Declarations">
        <header>Declarations</header>
      </section>
        <p>
          JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.
        </p>
        <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">var</a></code>
        <p>
          Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
        </p>
        <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">let</a></code>
        <p>
          Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
        </p>
        <code><a href="">const</a></code>
        <p>
          Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.
        </p>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (<code>_</code>), or dollar sign (<code>$</code>). Subsequent characters can also be digits (<code>0 – 9</code>). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters <code>A</code> through <code>Z</code> (uppercase) as well as <code>a</code> through <code>z</code> (lowercase).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, see <a href="https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers-es6">this blog post</a> or the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#identifiers">lexical grammar</a> reference.) You can also use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#string_literals">Unicode escape sequences</a> as characters in identifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some examples of legal names are <code>Number_hits</code>, <code>temp99</code>, <code>$credit</code>, and <code>_name</code>.

          Data structures and types
        </header>
        <p>
          The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Seven data types that are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive">primitives</a>:
            <ol>
              <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean">Boolean</a>. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
              <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null">null</a>. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, <code>null</code> is not the same as <code>Null</code>, <code>NULL</code>, or any other variant.)</li>
              <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/undefined">undefined</a>. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
              <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number">Number</a>. An integer or floating point number. For example: <code>42</code> or <code>3.14159</code>.</li>
              <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BigInt">BigInt</a>. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: <code>9007199254740992n</code>.</li>
              <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/String">String</a>. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: <code>"Howdy"</code>.</li>
              <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol">Symbol</a>. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object">Object</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful operations with your applications. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions">Functions</a> are the other fundamental elements of the language. While functions are technically a kind of object, you can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your script can perform.
