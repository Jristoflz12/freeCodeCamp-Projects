        <h2>Here are some of his highlights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Chester Charles Bennington was born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona.</li>
          <li>
            Bennington first began singing with a band called <span class="band">Sean Dowdell and His Friends?</span> in the early 90's. Later, he joined another band called <span class="band">Grey Daze</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1999 he joined Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, Brad Delson and Joe Hahn and their band <span class="band">Xero</span>, which was then renamed <span class="band">Hybrid Theory</span>
          </li>
          <li>Bennington and the band, now called <span class="band">Linkin Park</span> released their first album in late 2000. It was a massive success worldwide; so much so that it became the best selling-album of 2001. </li>
          <li>
            In 2005, Bennington co-founded <span class="band">Dead by Sunrise</span>, an electronic rock band from Los Angeles, California, with Orgy and Julien-K members Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck.
          </li>
          <li>In 2006, he married Talinda Ann Bentley, with whom he had three children: Tyler Lee Bennington and twins Lily and Lila. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Bennigton joined <span class="band">Stone Temple Pilots</span> in 2013, band which he dreamed of becoming a member of during his youth. He left the band on good terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015.
          </li>
          <li>
            Throughout the years, Bennington and Linkin Parkâ€™s impact extends beyond their music. They created Music for Relief in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and since then have been at the forefront of aiding humanitarian crises and addressing the issue of extreme global poverty.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chester Bennington passed away On July 20, 2017.

          "His cleanly articulated tales of emotional struggle gave millions the sense that someone understood them, and the huge sound of his band around him magnified that sense, moving listeners from the psychic space of their bedrooms into an arena of thousands of people who shared their pain".
